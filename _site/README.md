# Trinkler

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tale.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tale)

Trinkler is based on `Tale` a minimal Jekyll theme curated for storytellers. Checkout the demo [here](https://chesterhow.github.io/tale/).

## Features
- Easy installation
- Compatible with GitHub Pages
- Responsive design (looks just as good on mobile)
- Syntax highlighting, with the help of Pygments
- Markdown and HTML text formatting
- Pagination of posts

## Usage
Once you've installed the theme, you're ready to work on your Jekyll site. To start off, I would recommend updating `_config.yml` with your site's details.

To build and serve your site, run:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

to include the _draft_ posts run:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
```

to build production version run:

```bash
$ JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build
```

And you're all set! Head over to http://127.0.0.1:4000/ to see your site in action.
