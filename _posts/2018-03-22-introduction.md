This site is a collection of blog posts around web3 native topics such as
- `{block-, domain-, web-}` chains
- interconnectivity (polkadot) and
- distributed hosting (ipfs)

and their implications on Society.

Well designed `{block-, domain-, web-}` chains can be seen as the backend of a website whereas client-side web applications as their frontend.
