## Purpose

The _Trinkler Fellowship_ is a grant of CHF 50'000 to financially free up autodidacts, free thinkers and dreamers for a duration of one year to let them build what they _have_ to build.

## Mission

Many decision that we took as a society were based on the _assumption_ that future generations would improve on or fix existing problems. However the current educational system often produces a _clone-like_ mindset rather than _kind and emphatic, creative contrarians capable of questioning the way things are done_.

Our mission is to financial free up those for a year that would rather create world-changing technology than sitting in a classroom or cubicle.

## Vision

In a time of information abundance, the memory-based educational system has become outdated. It's time that we _iterate_ to something more sensible.


## Apply

Trinkler Fellowship is focused on young (`<25years`) people from Europe. We have a special affinity for open-source coders and university dropouts ❤.
