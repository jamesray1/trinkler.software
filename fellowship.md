## Purpose

The _Trinkler Fellowship_ is a grant of CHF 50'000 to autodidacts, free thinkers and dreamers for a duration of one year to let them build what they _have_ to build.
We aim to have two Fellows for the class of {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | plus: 1 }}.

## Mission

Many decisions that we took as a society were based on the _assumption_ that future generations would improve on or fix existing problems.

However traditional systems often produce people with a clone-like mindset unfit to tackle these problems. What we need are kind, empathetic and courageous people who are well-equipped to take them on.

Our mission is to financially free up those who would rather create world-changing technology than sit in a classroom or cubicle.

## Vision

To provide an opportunity for socially conscious individuals to ensure that technology caters to the overall benefit of humanity as opposed to its regression or undoing.

## Apply

Trinkler Fellowship is focused on people from Europe. We have a special affinity for open-source coders and university dropouts ‚ù§.
