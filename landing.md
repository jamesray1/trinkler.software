## A History of Interpersonal Exchange: From Byzantine to Blockchain

> The Exchange relation is the fundamental social relation. Interpersonal exchange of goods and services weaves the bond which unites men into society. - Ludwig Von Mises

### What is Interpersonal exchange?

![](https://i.imgur.com/60GOd98.jpg)

- _Standard definition:_ an exchange between two or more persons
- _Updated definition_ could be more generalised: an exchange between two or more _parties_ that can apply to more than just people

These exchanges are generally undertaken by way of some form of communication. This communication between parties can be divided up into three main parts:

- **Communication**: Within context of _communication_ Interpersonal exchange can be defined as communication between two or more parties;
- **Information**: These two or more parties generally communicate _Information_ or data with each other;
- **Exchange**: This data or information travels between one party to another by way of an _Exchange_. Information or data leaves one source and enters another. Then this information is responded to. The exchanges follow an input-output mechanism and this holds true for both humans and technology.

The advent of the Blockchain has largely redesigned and grown interpersonal exchange as we know it and this article will touch briefly upon its evolution, "from Byzantine to Blockchain."

### Part One: Byzantine

- _Systemic/Situational Definition:_ Excessively complicated, typically involving a great deal of administrative detail.
- _Historical/Systems of Rule Definition:_ Inspired by Byzantine Empire, meaning unbalanced and subject to corruption.
- Definition _in context of this article_ combines both, using excessive administration of the old world and abuse of power as items the Blockchain has sought to replace with more efficient operations.

Interpersonal exchange from a byzantine standpoint can be divided up into the following three categories:

- **Historical/Complexity:** From an historical standpoint, interactions between persons during the time of the Byzantine Empire (founded 330AD, dissolved 1453) were notoriously violent and conflictual. Thus systemically the era was notoriously complex. _byzantine complexity_ refers to an idea or system that is complicated, secret, and difficult to change.
- **Theoretical:** Byzantine General's Problem is a problem inspired by the theory that, using the Byzantine Empire as an example, a general encircling a central point (such as an enemy camp) with his troupes wishes to either attack or retreat, depending on the report of a messenger who can gather _inside information_ from this central point and bring it back. It refers to purposeful miscommunication/misinformation by a messenger that is intended to confuse a collective action arrived at by means of consensus and therefore foil attempted actions therefrom.
- **Technical:** Byzantine Fault/Tolerance:takes this concept of misinformation and applies it to distributed computing systems.

As a technological solution, the Blockchain has the potential to take the financial systems of old and decrease their _byzantine complexity_ by making the global financial system more transparent (emphasising the truth and not secrets/lies), less complicated (by way of increasing efficiency) and is immutable (cannot be undone and therefore cannot be changed). The _how_ of this will be explored further in the paragraph to follow.

### Part Two: Blockchain:

The Internet created a link between persons exchanging communications and technology. It helped individuals exchange information with one another without the need for any face-to-face interaction to occur. The Blockchain digitized the concept of interpersonal exchange further by emphasizing the following **three components**:

- **P2P exchanges, w.o. intermediaries**: The Blockchain paved the way for interpersonal exchanges wherein the exchange of information or assets could not be intercepted by any third party by using peer-to-peer encryption methods. Therefore parties involved in exchanges had the ability to keep these exchanges private and away from prying eyes.

Emphasis on increased security for exchanges continues to grow as further crytographic research is applied in the field. Elliptic curve cryptography **(ECC)** is an example of a type of encrytion being used in research, and is used for encryption by combining the key agreement with a symmetric encryption scheme.

- **Input-Output** as a form of exchange: I/O is defined as _communication between an information processing system (such as a computer) and the outside world._ This _outside world_ can be another information processing system of human being. Blockchain has provided people with a speedier way to communicate and to exchange information by enabling the exchange of information to occur simulataneously between both humans and information systems (humans communicate an input into a computer and this computer in turn communicates this information to another computer. This other computer receives this information and output and by extension so does the person on the other end of that communication who is using it).

This mechanism for exchange was initially enabled by the invention of the Internet but the Blockchain takes it a step further by promising a similar communications system whereby information processing systems no longer have to rely on sharing their communications with humans because they can become autonomous.

- **Continuous, immutable, autonomous exchanges (iteration)** This independence is achieved in a variety of ways and its success ultimately depends on finding a language that all blockchains can collectively apply, understand, and use to communicate and collaborate with one another. An important factor in this is ensuring that the language blockchains speak when communicating and exchanging information with one another is repetitive -- therefore by extension, easy for each chain to pick up and to follow.

This repetition from a mathematical standpoint can be seen as _iteration_. Ultimately, this iteration if implemented properly and using a universal language that all blockchains can understand has the potential to give blockchains their full autonomy. They can furthermore use it to communicate and exchange information with one another to continue growing a cooperative system amongst themselves.

### Part Three: How does interpersonal exchange tie into a catallactic society?

The advent of blockchain technology has changed the face of society as we know it. _We now exist within a new kind of society. A society that runs on a series of interpersonal exchanges of digitized assets in a digitized market economy. We call this new society a **catallactic society**._

### Part Four: The tools we build

_Amir Taaki's example of tools_: Our approach to tool-building using software as a means for doing so is inspired by Amir Taaki's approach to tools.

> As technologists, our job is to build tools for people to use. And we find ourselves in an empowering position because of the legacy left to us by many people over history who built the technology with certain ethics and morals in mind. As someone with a huge amount of skill you have a responsibility to carry that legacy onwards. - Amir Taaki
