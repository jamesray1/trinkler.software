Trinkler Software was created to ensure that technology caters to the overall benefit of society as opposed to its regression or undoing. _To build tools for a catallactic society._

Catallactics doesn’t only mean “to exchange”, or to “trade”, but also “to be accepted into a community” and “to turn a foe into a friend.” It is our hope that by building tools for a catallactic society, tools that cannot easily be undone and that stand the test of time, we can help build a global economy that is more inclusive and accepting to all who seek to partake in it.

Our vision is _to have come into this dark world like a bright star in the southern sky_ - Papyrus of Nebseni
